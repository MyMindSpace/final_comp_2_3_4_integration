# Component 2: Federated Emotion Model + 4-Stage Training

## Purpose
Provides sophisticated emotion analysis through privacy-preserving federated learning, evolving from rule-based detection to advanced self-supervised learning.

## Core Functions
- **Multi-Label Emotion Detection**: Identify multiple emotions simultaneously using CardiffNLP RoBERTa
- **Intensity Prediction**: Measure emotional strength on 0-1 scale with confidence scores
- **Personal Calibration**: Adapt to individual expression styles and cultural backgrounds
- **Federated Learning**: Improve collectively while keeping personal data on-device
- **Privacy Protection**: Differential privacy with ε≤1.0 guarantees per user

## Architecture Components
- **Local Emotion Model**: CardiffNLP base + intensity predictor + personal calibration layers
- **Federated Coordinator**: Manages training rounds, client selection, secure aggregation
- **Privacy Engine**: Adds calibrated noise to gradients, tracks privacy budget
- **Global Model**: Aggregated insights distributed back to all participants

## 4-Stage Training Pipeline

### Stage 1: Rule-Based Foundation
- Emotional vocabulary dictionaries with intensity modifiers
- Context-aware pattern matching for baseline emotion detection
- Immediate functionality while preparing ML models

### Stage 2: Supervised Learning
- Fine-tune on user-validated emotion labels and corrections
- Transfer learning from CardiffNLP to journal-specific patterns
- Cross-validation to prevent overfitting

### Stage 3: Federated Reinforcement Learning
- User engagement as reward signal for policy optimization
- Privacy-preserving gradient sharing across users
- Adaptive learning based on individual preferences

### Stage 4: Self-Supervised Learning
- Contrastive learning for emotion pattern discovery
- Temporal consistency across user's emotional journey
- Unsupervised discovery of new emotional expressions

## Privacy Implementation
- **Differential Privacy**: Gaussian noise injection with formal ε-δ guarantees
- **Secure Aggregation**: Homomorphic encryption for gradient combination
- **Local Processing**: Personal data never leaves user's device
- **Privacy Budget**: Automatic tracking and renewal every 6 months

## Performance Requirements
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ F1 score across emotion categories, 15%+ improvement with calibration
- **Privacy**: ε≤1.0 per user per 6 months, <55% membership inference success
- **Speed**: <200ms emotion analysis, <30min federated training rounds
- **Efficiency**: <2GB RAM during training, <10MB model updates

## Data Models
- **EmotionAnalysis**: emotions dict, intensity, confidence, calibration metadata
- **FederatedUpdate**: encrypted gradients, privacy noise level, performance metrics
- **UserCalibration**: personal adjustment factors, expression style patterns

## Quality Assurance
- Clinical validation against psychological assessment tools
- Cross-cultural testing for diverse backgrounds
- Regular privacy audits and attack resistance testing
- User feedback integration for continuous improvement
