## Processing Pipeline

### Feature Extraction
1. **Temporal Processing**: Convert timestamps to cyclical features, calculate recency metrics
2. **Emotion Processing**: Normalize emotion vectors, calculate dynamics and stability
3. **Semantic Processing**: Extract topics, calculate novelty, assess complexity
4. **User Processing**: Update behavioral patterns, calculate consistency metrics

### Feature Engineering
1. **Normalization**: Z-score normalization based on user's personal statistics
2. **Scaling**: Min-max scaling for bounded features like time and emotions
3. **Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical features, embeddings for high-cardinality
4. **Combination**: Concatenate all feature vectors into unified representation

### Quality Control
1. **Validation**: Check for missing values, outliers, and feature drift
2. **Consistency**: Ensure feature stability across similar entries
3. **Dimensionality**: Optimize feature vector size for memory gate performance
4. **Update**: Continuously refine features based on model performance
